# Toronto Rental Housing

This project conducts an analysis on rental housing in Toronto. We obtained this data from the data file toronto-apartment-building-evaluations.csv from https://github.com/awstringer1/sta238-book/tree/master/data/apartment-data. We use this data to compare the quality of apartment options around two universities in Toronto, University of Toronto St George campus and Toronto Metropolitan University, in wards 11 and 13 respectively.
